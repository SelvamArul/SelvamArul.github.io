# About me:

I am a Ph.D. fellow in the [Autonomous Intelligent Systems group](http://ais.uni-bonn.de/) headed by [Prof. Dr. Sven Behnke](http://ais.uni-bonn.de/behnke/). I am interested in representations, learning, and refinement of 6D object poses for scene understanding. As a part of my research, I developed [StilllebenDR](https://ais-bonn.github.io/stillleben/), a light-weight, fast differentiable renderer. Before starting my Ph.D., I did my master's in computer science at the University of Bonn. I was working as a research assistant in the systems group during most of my master's studies. My publications list can be found [here](https://selvamarul.github.io//publications/). I am lucky to be a part of [Team Nimbro](https://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/nimbro/MBZIRC/) and [Team Nimber Picking](https://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/nimbro/Picking/). Our teams won multiple international competitions. A complete list of the competitions can be found [here](https://selvamarul.github.io//competitions/).
