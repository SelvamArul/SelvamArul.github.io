I am a Research Scientist in Edge Computing at Siemens AG. Previously, I earned my Ph.D. at the University of Bonn within the [Autonomous Intelligent Systems group](http://ais.uni-bonn.de/), led by [Prof. Dr. Sven Behnke](http://ais.uni-bonn.de/behnke/). I also hold a Master’s in Computer Science from the same institution.
As a member of [Team NimbRo](https://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/nimbro/MBZIRC/) and [Team NimbRo Picking](https://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/nimbro/Picking/), I have contributed to several international competition victories. Explore my list of [publications](http://selvamarul.github.io/arul/publications/), [robotics competition history](https://selvamarul.github.io/arul/robotics-competitions/), or [CV](http://selvamarul.github.io/arul/cv/) for more details.
