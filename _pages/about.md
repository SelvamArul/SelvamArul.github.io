# About me:
I am postdoctoral researcher at Siemens AG.
Before joining Siemens, I was a  Ph.D. fellow in the [Autonomous Intelligent Systems group](http://ais.uni-bonn.de/) headed by [Prof. Dr. Sven Behnke](http://ais.uni-bonn.de/behnke/). I am interested in representations, learning, and refinement of 6D object poses for scene understanding. 
Before starting my Ph.D., I did my master's in computer science at the University of Bonn. I was working as a research assistant in the [Autonomous Intelligent Systems group](http://ais.uni-bonn.de/) during most of my master's studies. My publications list can be found [here](https://selvamarul.github.io//publications/). I am lucky to be a part of [Team NimbRo](https://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/nimbro/MBZIRC/) and [Team NimbRo Picking](https://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/nimbro/Picking/). Our teams won multiple international competitions. A complete list of the competitions can be found [here](https://selvamarul.github.io//competitions/). My short CV can be found [here](http://selvamarul.github.io/cv/).
