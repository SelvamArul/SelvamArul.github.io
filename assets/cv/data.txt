Established research initiatives and successfully secured European Union (EU) funding for confidential edge computing projects.
Developed real-time confidential computing capabilities for a Docker-based edge platform, contributing across the full technology stack from real-time networking and virtualization layers to guest kernel components and system-level integration.
Contributed to the development of a large language model (LLM)-based internal code search service.
Supervised interns and working students, providing mentorship and guidance in technical projects.


Introduced novel vision transformer algorithms for multi-object 6D pose estimation and tracking in cluttered environments.
Developed pose refinement and shape refinement methods using render-and-compare techniques, and co-developed a highly efficient differentiable renderer for scalable render-and-compare operations.
Implemented simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and navigation modules for mobile robotics applications.
Deployed deep learning models on Google Edge TPUs and NVIDIA Jetson platforms for edge computing applications.
Supervised Master's and Bachelor's theses, laboratory courses, and academic seminars.


Implemented a comprehensive navigation stack for autonomous exploration robotics applications.
Developed an object detection module for mobile robot perception and autonomous operation.
Implemented semantic segmentation and pose estimation modules for automated bin-picking robotic systems.
